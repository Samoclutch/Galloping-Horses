  "description": "Changes to horse movement, specifically inspired by Battlefield 1 horse mechanics.\nHorses have 3 running state, plotting, trotting, and galloping, with each state having its own max and min speed.\nThey move in the direction of the rider's look angle modified by the rider's keyboard input (pressing S moves the horse backwards from your look angle).\nGo up states by pressing the sprint button, down states by letting go of all movement keys and letting the horse slow down.\nMore to come.",
