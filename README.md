Changes Horses to have cooler, more cinematic movement mechanics like the ones in Battlefield 1. Almost exactly like Battlefield 1.

I have a really cool Tectonic world going but I could get good screenshots because the stupid horse always had its head in the way. I couldn't find anything to improve this, so I learned basic modding and made this in about a week. Supremely untested, feel free to email me with any bug reports, suggestions, or advice.

Any movement key makes the horse move in the direction of the player rider's look angle rotated by their movement input (i.e., pressing S makes the horse run the oppisite direction of the player's perspective). 
Horses also progress through 3 running states, plotting, trotting, and galloping, with each state having its own minimum and maximum speeds. Pressing sprint moves the horse up a state, and it naturally slows down when the player releases the movement keys. 
Additionally, trying to turn 170 degrees around will cause the horse to quickly slow down and turn faster.

I hope to add more game versions and features soon. Very early release currently.
